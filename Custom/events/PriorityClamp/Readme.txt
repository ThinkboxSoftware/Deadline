What everyone's been waiting for, a way to limit users from hogging the farm.

The idea is that you can prevent everyone but blessed users from a specific
user group from submitting jobs higher than a certain priority.

Copy this whole folder into '[repo]/custom/events', reload the scripts in your
Monitor under the 'tools' menu, and go into 'Configure Plugins' to set up what
user group you'd like to bless with allowing submissions higher than the
maximum (also settable).

For those unfamiliar with user groups, check out the 7.0 documetation on the
subject:
