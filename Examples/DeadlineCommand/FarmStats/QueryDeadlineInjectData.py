'''
    QueryDeadlineInjectData.py - Capture and record custom job statistics

    Puesdo-code:
    Check every active job in the queue:
    IF job is currently active (rendering/queued) THEN
        Return job object & tasks and calculate job stats object
        Query & inject average frame render time into column "ExtraInfo2" for each job
        Query & inject peak ram usage into column "ExtraInfo3" for each job

    Notes:
    1. It is assumed a studio will rename the "ExtraInfo2" column used to something more meaningful such as "Average Frame Render Time" via repo options
    2. It is assumed a studio will rename the "ExtraInfo3" column used to something more meaningful such as "Peak RAM Usage" via repo options
    2. It is assumed we are only checking currently "Active" & "Queued" jobs only
    3. It is assumed we are running this python script on a machine that has the Deadline client software already installed
