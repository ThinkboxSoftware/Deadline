farm_stats_csv.py
===================
This script will dump the state from all the jobs in the queue and dump that
data into a file named jobs.csv next to this script.

It shows a few ways to interrogate Python.net objects to get the data you want
such as formatting TimeSpans and .net Strings.

It's also possible to filter out any data that isn't relevant to your use case
by adjusting the 'filter_prexes' list.
