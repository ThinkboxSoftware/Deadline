'''
    OverrideIPs.py - Assign IP overrides to a list of Slaves
    
    This should work on Deadline 6 and 7's APIs. If there are problems,
    please report them to support@thinkboxsoftware.com
    
    RepositoryUtils.GetSlaveSettings will return an empty, valid,
    SlaveSettings object. Change 'slaveNameX' entries below to avoid
    creating fake Slaves within the Database.
